# plane-point-ransac
A common problem in Robotics perception / SLAM / computer vision is estimating planes in a scene (commonly, walls / floor in indoor environmens) . For a point-cloud representation of the scene obtained from a LIDAR/ Stereo-cam / RGBD scanner, this can be done via a RANSAC approach.


Code : RANSAC to fit a number of planes to a noisy point cloud. Python code.
